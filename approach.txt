Here is the approach taken to build the application

* Packages used:
    1. file system package : reaa/write data
    2. yargs package : parse commands and arguments
    3. chalk : color the text of CLI

*DB.json as the DB
    In the application DB.json acts as a DB where all the notes are stored in a array as json
    format, read write and modify are done directly to this file.
    
*Adding a notes
    command 'add' is setup by yargs command api and the real addition is done by 'addNote'
    method.
    A generic function named 'loadNotes' first acces the DB and gets the array of notes,
